# Predictive-Analytics-for-Term-Deposit-Subscription

This repository contains code, resources, and insights derived from predictive analytics on a Portuguese bank's marketing campaigns to forecast client subscription behaviour regarding term deposits.

# Business Problem Overview
The Portuguese bank has encountered a revenue decline due to reduced client deposits. The goal is to predict client subscription likelihood for term deposits to identify potential subscribers and focus marketing efforts accordingly.

# Key Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Insights**:
**Age Impact:** Clients above 60 years and below 30 years exhibit a higher probability of term deposit subscription.
**Loan & Housing:** Clients without a loan display a higher probability of subscribing.
**Duration Influence:** Subscribed clients often have a duration over 300.
